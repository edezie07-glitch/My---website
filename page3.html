          <p class="p1" > I graduated from San Alfonso High School Inc. (SAHSI), located in Poblacion, Sabangan, Mt. Province.
      I first became a student-athlete in 10th grade, representing the province as a swimmer.
      From my first year of joining until I graduated from high school, 
      I consistently received gold medals from the CSMP Artist SAO Office for my achievements. 
      Aside from being an athlete, I actively participated in extracurricular activities such as poster-making and drawing competitions. 
      I was also a member of the dance club and joined various sports competitions both inside and outside the CSMP schools. 
      In addition, I served as an altar officer and took part in several school leadership programs.</p>
